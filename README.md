# ffplayout-installer

    Standalone installer for the ffplayout app collection

Run `install.sh` as *root* for full installation.

A debian based system is recommend.

CentOS 8+ and Fedora can work, but is not widely tested. If you really need it, you have to apply SeLinux rules.
For that you have **selinux.sh**, check this script carefully if the rules a ok for you.

The most tested system is **Debian 10**.

If you prefer a dockerized version of ffplayout, checkout [ffplayout-docker](https://github.com/ffplayout/ffplayout-docker)
